- **Scikit-Learn** (ML models)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

# 📊 1. Data Cleaning

Performed:
- Handling missing values  
  - Filled `age` using **median**  
  - Filled `embarked` + `embark_town` using **mode**  
  - Dropped `deck` column (70%+ missing)  
- Removing duplicates  
- Detecting outliers using boxplots  
- Deciding to **keep real-world outliers** (e.g., high fares)

# 📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were created:

### ✔ Histograms  
Show distribution of numerical variables (`age`, `fare`).

### ✔ Correlation Heatmap  
Used to identify relationships between:
- age  
- pclass  
- fare  
- sibsp  
- parch  
- survived  

### ✔ Pair Plot  
Visualizes pairwise relationships between features.

### ✔ Box Plots  
Used to detect and interpret outliers and compare distributions across groups (e.g., survival vs age).

# 🧪 3. Statistical Hypothesis Tests

### ✔ **Two-sample t-test**
Compared mean ages of:
- Survived passengers  
- Did not survive  

### ✔ **Chi-square test**
Checked relationship between:
- Sex  
- Survival  

(Strong dependency found.)

### ✔ **ANOVA**
Compared fare differences across:
- 1st class  
- 2nd class  
- 3rd class  

(Fares differ significantly.)

# 📉 4. Regression Modeling

Built a **linear regression model** to predict **fare** using:  
- age  
- pclass  
- sibsp  
- parch  

Evaluated using:
- R² score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

# 🤖 5. Machine Learning Model (Survival Prediction)

Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict **survival** using features:  
- pclass  
- sex  
- age  
- fare  
- sibsp  
- parch  
- alone  

Evaluated with:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

---

# 🧱 6. Feature Engineering

Created new features:
- `family_size` = sibsp + parch + 1  
- `is_child` (child indicator)  
- `fare_per_person`  

These features improved the interpretability and predictive power.

---

# 📝 7. Key Insights

- **Females had a much higher survival rate** than males.  
- Passengers in **1st class survived more** than 2nd and 3rd.  
- **Younger passengers (especially children)** had higher survival probability.  
- Fare varies drastically by class — confirmed through ANOVA.  
- Logistic regression identifies **sex** and **pclass** as the strongest predictors.
